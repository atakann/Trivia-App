# Frontend - Trivia API

## Getting Setup

> _tip_: this frontend is designed to work with [Flask-based Backend](../backend) so it will not load successfully if the backend is not working or not connected. 

### Installing Dependencies

1. **Installing Node and NPM**
   This project depends on Nodejs and Node Package Manager (NPM). Before continuing, you must download and install Node (the download includes NPM) from [https://nodejs.com/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

2. **Installing project dependencies**
   This project uses NPM to manage software dependencies. NPM Relies on the package.json file located in the `frontend` directory of this repository. After cloning, open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install
```

> _tip_: `npm i`is shorthand for `npm install``
